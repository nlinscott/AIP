Android Image Processor
=====================

Uses C++ and OpenCV to save different sized images when developing for Android.

Android Image Processor CLI

I recently started working with android and found out that in order
to develop for all screen sizes, we have to have several different sized
images included with the project. Of course, I probably wont be using too many
images, if someone needs to use some, this tool can create the sizes they want for their project.


SYNTAX:

*its a Command Line Interface. Deal with it.

Example:

/* still working on this part */

stay tuned, folkz!
